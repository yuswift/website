The built-in Jenkins cannot share the same email configuration with platform notification system. Thus we need to set email server for KubeSphere DevOps pipeline separately.

> Note: Please be aware that the modification of the email server in `ks-jenkins` deployment below will restart the deployment itself. Consequently, the DevOps system will be unavailable for a few minutes. Please make such modification at an appropriate time.
> Prerequisites: You need to enable KubeSphere DevOps System.

1. Log in KubeSphere by using `admin` account, navigate to **Platform**.

2. Then go to **Application Workloads â†’ Workloads**, choose namespace and drill into **kubesphere-devops-system**. Then choose **ks-jenkins** to **Edit Yaml**.
